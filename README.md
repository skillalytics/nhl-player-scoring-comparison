# NHL Player Scoring Comparison
This model takes NHL skater stats from the 1922 season to the present (2019-2020 season) and normalizes scoring data (goals, assists, points) of all players to allow for comparison of players across different eras.

The complete project can be found [here](http://skillalytics.com/projects/player-scoring-comparison.php).

An output of the adjusted career statsitics along with actual values for each player can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/skilliland#!/vizhome/NHLPlayerScoringComparison/SummaryDashboard).
